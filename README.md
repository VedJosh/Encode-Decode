# Encode Decode
# Caesar Cipher
Overview
The Caesar Cipher is a simple and well-known encryption technique used in cryptography. This project allows users to encode and decode messages using the Caesar cipher method by shifting letters in the alphabet.

# Features
Encoding: Convert plaintext messages into encoded text by shifting letters.
Decoding: Revert encoded messages back to plaintext.
Input Flexibility: Handle both lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as non-alphabet characters.
Interactive User Interface: User-friendly prompts for input and options.
How It Works
The Caesar cipher works by replacing each letter in the plaintext with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1:

A becomes B
B becomes C
Z wraps around to A
Shift Logic
Encoding: Each letter's position is incremented by the shift value.
Decoding: Each letter's position is decremented by the shift value.
# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
# Example
Input:
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
3
Output:
vbnet
Copy code
The encoded text is khoor
